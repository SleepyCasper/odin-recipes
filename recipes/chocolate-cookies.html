            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                   <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
                   <li>Mix sugar, cocoa, and oil together in a medium bowl. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until combined. Stir in vanilla.</li>
                   <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in another bowl. Gradually stir flour mixture into the cocoa mixture until thoroughly mixed. Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.</li>
                   <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll or scoop chilled dough into 1-inch balls. Coat each ball in confectioners' sugar and place 1 inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
                   <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Let stand on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool. Repeat Step 4 to make the remaining batches.</li>
